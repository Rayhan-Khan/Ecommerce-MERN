            Lorrent Name Meaning Historically, 
            surnames evolved as a way to sort people in
            to groups - by occupation, place of origin, clan affiliation, 
            patronage, parentage, adoption, and even physical characteristics (like red hair). 
            Many of the modern surnames in the dictionary can be traced back to Britain and Ireland.
